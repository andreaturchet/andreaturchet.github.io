                <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the iterative nature of the machine learning lifecycle is pivotal for successful ML projects, ensuring systematic data preparation, model development, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement. Unveiling its stages through a real-world case study in customer churn prediction, this chapter showcases practical implications.

                <h2 id="sdlc">2. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h2>
                <p>
                    The traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) refers to a structured approach to building software systems. It emphasizes a well-defined sequence of phases, each with specific goals and deliverables, that guides the development process from initial planning to final deployment and maintenance.
                </p>

                <h3>SDLC Phases</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Planning and Requirement Analysis:</strong> Identifying project scope, goals, and stakeholders’ needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Defining Requirements:</strong> Documenting specific and detailed requirements (RSD/SRS).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Designing the Product Architecture:</strong> Creating high-level and low-level designs, defining system components and database structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Building or Developing the Product:</strong> Actual coding and software component creation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Product Testing and Integration:</strong> Rigorous testing (unit, integration, system, UAT) to ensure quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deployment and Maintenance:</strong> Deploying to production and ongoing monitoring/bug fixing.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="note">
                    The Software Development Lifecycle is iterative, and feedback from each stage often feeds back into earlier stages for continuous improvement.
                </div>

                <h3>SDLC Models</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> Sequential and linear approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agile Model:</strong> Flexible, iterative, focuses on collaboration (sprints, scrums).</li>
                    <li><strong>V-Model:</strong> Structured model where each development stage has a corresponding testing phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spiral Model:</strong> Combination of waterfall and agile with a focus on risk management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototype Model:</strong> Creating rough versions and refining based on feedback.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="limitations">3. Limitations of Traditional SDLC for ML</h2>
                <p>
                    While traditional methodologies serve well for standard software, they face limitations in ML projects due to the unique nature of ML development:
                </p>

                <div class="definition">
                    <div class="definition-term">Rigid Sequential Phases</div>
                    Traditional phases don't align with the iterative, experimental nature of ML (data collection, training, evaluation cycles).
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <div class="definition-term">Changing Requirements</div>
                    ML projects often have evolving requirements as data quality changes or new insights emerge.
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <div class="definition-term">Limited Flexibility</div>
                    SDLC lacks the flexibility needed for experimenting with various algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                    <div class="definition-term">Complexity of Model Validation</div>
                    ML validation involves not just code but data quality, model accuracy, and performance against diverse datasets.
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In a healthcare predictive model project, a traditional approach might fail if new data reveals insights not captured in original requirements. Iterative improvements would require revisiting earlier stages, causing delays. An agile/iterative ML lifecycle allows for continuous refinement.
                </p>

                <h2 id="ml-lifecycle">4. Machine Learning Lifecycle</h2>
                <p>
                    A successful ML project requires a comprehensive understanding of business objectives, data collection, analysis, model development, and ongoing evaluation. The ML lifecycle is a structured approach helping companies allocate resources efficiently.

                    Assessing performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (Classification) or MAE, MSE, RMSE (Regression). Checks for overfitting/underfitting and benchmarking against baselines.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 6: Model Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Integrating models into production. Involves environment setup (Docker, Cloud), API creation, scalability planning, and security implementation.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 7: Model Monitoring and Maintenance</h3>
                <p>

                <h2 id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The ML lifecycle is dynamic and distinct from traditional software development. It requires a comprehensive approach covering problem formulation, data handling, modeling, and continuous maintenance. The iterative nature ensures models remain effective in evolving real-world scenarios.
