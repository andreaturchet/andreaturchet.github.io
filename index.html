            Nuclear energy emerged out of atomic science advancements during WWII and enjoyed several decades of significant expansion to address industrializing nations’ energy demands. Over many years, 
            nuclear energy saw significant growth worldwide; countries invested heavily in nuclear infrastructure, using its power to drive advancements in cities, medicine, and industry.
            Nuclear energy appeared limitless in its potential, sparking imaginations everywhere.
            The data used to develop this project come from Ember’s Yearly Electricity Data; Ember’s European Electricity Review; Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy and ElectricityMap.

            During 10 months spent in Spain for the Erasmus experience I worked on a research project with the title 'Predicting the reactivity pulse values of a TRIGA nuclear reactor, a neural networks 
            approach'. This research aims to develop and apply a neural network in the field of nuclear engineering; using Deep Learning algorithms it is possible to increase 
            the safety of reactors and facilitate the work done by the technicians.

            Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. **Hadley Wickham**</br>
            In june 2021 I shared my data science project concerning the psychological effects of the covid-19 pandemic throughout a specific lockdown period, entitled 'covidstress-project'.
            Evaluated in the examination with the highest judgment value, 30 cum lauda.

            Between May and June 2022 I participated in a team competition proposed by the machine learning course teacher in which the goal was to use machine learning techniques 
            and models to seek a solution to the problem of Income Prediction. My team won the competition, achieving an accuracy value of 0.87 using supervised learning techniques.

            In Erasmus I took a university course in autonomous robotic in which as a final exam with my team we presented a project entitled "Development of a Robot for Hazardous Environment Tasks";
            within the course we completed several tasks including the development of Kalman and particle
            filters using python as programming language and finally the development of proportional-integral-derivative controllers to manage the robot's movements in space.

          My connection with technology began in 2013 when I started to understand how an android operating system works,
          therefore I started to create my own custom roms using as base the source codes of some popular aftermarket firmwares.
          In that time I met many people who contributed to the growth of my skills, @gokulbalram was my first guru and he deserves a special thanks.
          Like everything on this earth, this chapter of my life also came to an end, in 2017, after completing my latest job: an AOSP Porting for the ASUS Zenfone 2,
          powered by an Intel CPU.
          With the beginning of my university career, I deepened data science, generative and crypto art, blockchain and ethics related to technology.
          I like to work in dynamic, social environments where my creativity is encouraged. I believe that great goals can be achieved by reaching out to others, 
          sharing your vision and valuing their input.
          The fundamental question I ask myself is: can an artificial intelligence in a near future think and act like a human? Make rational choices? Feels emotions?</br>

                   <cite>Social media is a drug. We have a basic biological imperative to connect with other people. That directly affects the release of dopamine and the reward pathway.
                   Millions of years of evolution are behind that system to get us to come together and live in communities, to find mates, to propagate our species. 
                   So there's no doubt that a vehicle like social media, which optimized this connection between people,
                   is going to have the potential for addictions.</cite>
